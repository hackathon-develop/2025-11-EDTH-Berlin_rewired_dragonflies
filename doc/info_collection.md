    - .... Alternative To Customizing hwdef.dat¶: Instead of creating a separate branch and modifying the hwdef file, you can also insert Lua scripts or even informational files into the ROMFS of the build. Simply go to the top level of your ArduPilot git checkout and create a sub-folder named “ROMFS_custom” in the root of the source tree. Place your LUA scripts in a sub-folder in this directory, named “scripts” (i.e. the path ardupilot/ROMFS_custom/scripts). You can have other sub-folders for informational files and these will be included and viewable when examining the @ROMFS folder with MAVFtp.
