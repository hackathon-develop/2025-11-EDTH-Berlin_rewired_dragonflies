### -----------------------

Based on my research, there is no single price for this capability. The cost is determined by the specific **infrared technology** used, which splits the market into two very different price brackets.

To reliably **detect** a person at 2 kilometers (2,000 meters), you are at the absolute limit of high-end *uncooled* cameras and well into the standard range of *cooled* cameras.

Here is a price breakdown by category.

### 1\. High-Performance Uncooled LWIR Systems

These are the most common types of thermal cameras. They use an **uncooled microbolometer sensor**, require less maintenance, and are less expensive. To achieve a 2km detection range, they must be paired with a high-resolution sensor (at least 640x512) and a very powerful, long-focal-length lens.

  * **Estimated Price (Component):** **$4,000 – $9,000**
      * This range typically covers a high-end **uncooled** thermal PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera system from a non-premium manufacturer (often seen on B2B marketplaces).
  * **Estimated Price (Premium Brand):** **$10,000 – $25,000+**
      * This is the price range for systems from top-tier security manufacturers like **Teledyne FLIR** or **Axis Communications**. This price includes a rugged, weatherproof PTZ housing, advanced analytics, and network integration. For example, a specialized long-range uncooled PTZ system falls into this category.

**Limitation:** At 2km, an uncooled camera will provide basic *detection* (a few hot pixels on a screen) but will struggle to provide clear detail for *recognition*.

-----

### 2\. Cooled MWIR Systems

This is the professional and military-grade solution. These cameras use a **cryogenically cooled sensor** (Mid-Wave Infrared), making them far more sensitive to temperature differences. This allows them to see smaller objects at greater distances with much higher clarity and contrast, even in difficult atmospheric conditions.

  * **Estimated Price (Core & Lens):** **$30,000 – $70,000**
      * This is the typical cost for just the cooled camera *core* and the specialized long-range lens. Cooled thermal binoculars with this range often start at **$40,000**.
  * **Estimated Price (Full System):** **$70,000 – $150,000+**
      * This is the price for a complete, integrated long-range surveillance system. This includes the cooled camera, a long-range visible-light camera, a laser rangefinder, and a heavy-duty, gyro-stabilized pan-tilt mount for stable imaging.

### Summary: Price vs. Capability

| Technology | Price Range (Full System) | Performance at 2km |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Uncooled (LWIR)** | **$4,000 – $25,000** | **Detection:** Good (Can see a hot spot) <br> **Recognition:** Poor |
| **Cooled (MWIR)** | **$70,000 – $150,000+** | **Detection:** Excellent <br> **Recognition:** Good (Can tell it's a person) |

For a simple "is someone there?" application, a high-end uncooled system may be sufficient. For any serious security, border patrol, or military application where you need to know *what* you are looking at, a **cooled MWIR system** is the required solution.


### -----------------------

Based on a thorough investigation, a public price for the **Hensoldt Spexer 360** radar is **not available**.

This class of equipment is specialized military hardware, not sold as an "off-the-shelf" commercial product. The price is determined by large, complex procurement contracts that are not made public.

However, my research into the market, competitor systems, and related contracts allows for a detailed breakdown of the Spexer family and a strong, data-backed estimate of its probable cost.

### 1. Key Finding: Spexer 360 vs. Spexer 2000

It is critical to distinguish the Spexer 360 from the more advanced (and much more expensive) **Spexer 2000**. The Spexer 360 is a lightweight ground surveillance radar, while the Spexer 2000 is a high-performance air defense radar.

| Feature | **Hensoldt Spexer 360** (Your Query) | **Hensoldt Spexer 2000 MkIII** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Role** | Ground Surveillance, Border Security, Infrastructure Protection | Counter-UAS (C-UAS), Air Defense (VSHORAD) |
| **Technology** | X-Band Doppler Radar | AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) |
| **Weight** | ~20 kg (Man-Portable) | ~35-40 kg (Antenna only) |
| **Target** | Walking person (4 km), Micro-UAV (1.6 km) | >300 targets, fast-moving aerial threats (up to 40 km) |
| **Price Point** | Described as "affordable" with "low cost of ownership" | Part of high-value systems (e.g., Skyranger 30) |

The large, high-value contracts you may see mentioned online (such as the **€100 million deal** for Rheinmetall's Skyranger) are for the **Spexer 2000**, not the Spexer 360.

### 2. Market-Based Price Estimation for the Spexer 360

While no direct price exists, we can establish a credible price range by analyzing the market for similar lightweight, man-portable, ground-surveillance radars.

* **Low-End Baseline:** Generic, non-Western man-portable surveillance radars are listed on B2B marketplaces for approximately **$20,000 to $30,000 per unit**. This represents the absolute floor for this technology.
* **High-End Competitor Contracts:** Top-tier Western competitors like **FLIR (Ranger series)** and **Thales (GO-12)** sell their systems through large, multi-year contracts, often bundled with cameras, software, and vehicles.
    * The U.S. Army has previously awarded contracts like **$8.8 million** for an unspecified number of "FLIR Ranger radars."
    * A single integrated vehicle system (radar, camera, software) for border patrol can cost **$1 million or more**, with the radar being a significant component.
* **Competitor Market:** Blighter, a direct UK-based competitor, recently announced a **£25 million order book** for its B400 series (a direct Spexer 360 competitor), indicating a healthy market for these systems.

### 3. Estimated Price

Given this data, a single **Hensoldt Spexer 360** radar unit, when purchased as part of a government or military contract, is estimated to be in the **high-five-figure to low-six-figure range.**

> **Estimated Unit Cost: $80,000 – $150,000+**

This price is for the radar unit alone. The final contract price would be much higher, depending on the number of units, training, integration with camera systems (EO/IR sensors), command-and-control software, and long-term maintenance support.
